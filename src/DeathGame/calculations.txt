explanation for calculations

4 attributes:
intelligence: self explanatory
strength: self explanatory
sociability: introverted vs extraverted
empathy: basically kindness, understanding of emotions

for example, byakuya togami would have high intelligence, low strength, medium-high sociability and low empathy

we have to run a few calculations, but they boil down to chance of killing and chance of dying.

chance of dying is broken into:
- ease of killing (low sociability, low strength)
- lack of will to live (low sociability, low empathy, no relationships)
- how much of a threat they are (high intelligence, high sociability)

chance of killing is broken into:
- likelihood of success (high strength)
- likelihood of escape/getting away with it (high sociability, high empathy, high intelligence)
- lack of relationships (they don't want to kill their friends, so low empathy)

lastly, we have to combine the chances of people killing/dying in order to create a comprehensive probability.
we can do this by dividing the individual chances by the sum of chances.

we will add another probability: after the murderer is chosen, they will have a chance of getting away with it.
this allows for differing death games where the murderer actually wins.
