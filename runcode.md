# Running our code





## Main Menu

Running the main menu allows the user to use a GUI to select which program to run, rather than having to run an individual file. The menu (shown below) will have 3 buttons, Death Game Simulation, Double Pendulum Simulation, and Single Pendulum Simulation. Clicking the buttin will create an instance of each simulation in a new window.
