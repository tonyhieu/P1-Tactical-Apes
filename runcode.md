# Running our code

## Main Menu

Running the main menu allows the user to use a GUI to select which program to run, rather than having to run an individual file. The menu (shown below) will have 3 buttons, Death Game Simulation, Double Pendulum Simulation, and Single Pendulum Simulation. Clicking the buttin will create an instance of each simulation in a new window.

## Double Pendulum

To run the Double Pendulum Simulation, first click Double Pendulum on the main menu. That should bring the user to the window below.

</p>

At this window, the user can click on the first 3, which would lead them to the window below. This window allows the user to change the mass and length of the pendulum. Once the user is done, they can click set values to save the settings. If the user re opens the window by clicking the same edit settings button again, the previously set settings should still be there.

After editing the settings, the user can click the run simulation button to see the simulation. For debugging purposes, the button currently opens a window that has no simulation, but it will start a simulation once the code is debugged and updated.

## Survival Game

After clicking the button called "Death Game Simulation", you'll be taken to a page that looks like this.

Click on "Create New Participant" to add a new button that will allow you to create your own participant. Clicking on the new button will take you to a page with sliders.

You can drag the sliders around to edit the attributes of your participant. Every aspect of your participant will save even after you leave the window, including their name! You can keep adding as many participants as you want. The Start Simulation button is not functional at the moment.
